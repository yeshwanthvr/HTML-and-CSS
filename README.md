# Guide to the repository
Hello everyone , I am Yeshwanth VR. I have created this repository to share my HTML and CSS projects to the world. The HTML files are provided and their CSS code is present inside
a sheet called as "Styles.css". All of the CSS is stored in this file with comments to guide you the CSS code for different HTML files.

Note : Some HTML files have a CSS code whereas some files don't have a CSS code.
