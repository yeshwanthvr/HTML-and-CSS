    <div class="text">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2nd October, 1869 in Porbander , Gujarat. He fought for India's Independence. When he was once travelling in a train in South Africa, the train collector told him to sit in the second class even though Gandhiji had booked a first class ticket. This was the racial discrimination which Gandhiji faced. He then fought for equality among the whites and the blacks in South Africa. He then came to India and saw that the British were ruling India. He then started the Non - Cooperation Movement in the early 1920s because of the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy where Indians were forced not to use foreign goods and not to study in English schools. He even started the Dandi March in the 1930s when the British imposed heavy tax on salt and banned people from makig salt.
